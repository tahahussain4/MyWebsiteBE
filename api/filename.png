In return for the NSLSC providing you with on-line services, you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions of use:

    You consent to the collection of information requested by us for the purposes of providing you with on-line services. You also certify that any information provided about you is true, accurate and complete.
    You agree to keep your Password and Username secret, and not to share them with anyone. If you forget them or suspect that others have obtained them, you agree to report it to us immediately.
    The NSLSC will revoke your access to on-line services at your request. It may also revoke your access if you fail to abide by these terms and conditions of use, as a security measure or for administrative purposes (for example, when your Username and Password have been inactive for an extended period of time).
    You agree that the NSLSC and the Government of Canada are not responsible for any losses incurred by anyone:
        because of any matter outside of their control, including the availability of the Internet;
        because NSLSC On-Line Services are not available for any reason; or
        because you failed to comply with these terms and conditions of use.
    You will not alter or tamper with the software operating the NSLSC's On-Line services.
    You agree to abide by any changes to these terms and conditions of use that are published on the NSLSC Web site [www.csnpe-nslsc.cibletudes-canlearn.ca] until such time as you request us to revoke your access to on-line services.
    Access to the NSLSC On-Line Services involves the use of encryption software. In certain countries, other than Canada and the United States, the use of encryption software may be prohibited by the laws of those countries. You understand that you should not access the NSLSC services on-line in a country other than Canada or the United States without first checking the laws of that country.
